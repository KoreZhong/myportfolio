		<div id="body1"> <p> My Wampum bead in VR: Wampum was an antecedent to blockchain technology, which used story as part of its structure.

Every month, 55 million people play Minecraft, often hosting customized versions of collaborative worlds on their own home computers. The rules, formats, stories, and “mods” that these communities create are invite-only, and if you are lucky enough to receive an invitation, you will likely be talking, chatting, trolling with them on Discord, along with 130 million other users. If you want to learn the stories from these communities you can watch them live on Twitch, where a million people are watching at any given point in time. There are millions of stories created by collectives, hordes, bands, tribes, teams and pods that you may never know about or be able to follow. There are 1.8 billion gamers around the world who are probably ok with that.
These new formats are popular because they meet a deep psychological need: the basic human drive to interact with other people through stories. I call this new way of telling stories “decentralized storytelling.”
Decentralized storytelling only seems new. Although these forms make use of 21st century technologies, many of these techniques have a precedent in much older storytelling traditions. My thinking on this method for communicating through time is heavily informed by my native tradition (I am Seneca-Cayuga, Haudenosaunee, a “‘Native New Yorker” lol). My community has practiced decentralized storytelling for generations.
To those of us schooled in 20th century forms of storytelling — writing, film, radio, television — these new decentralized forms may not be recognizable as stories at all. Unlike publishing, radio, film, and television, which broadcast from a single source to an audience of many, decentralized storytelling networks are peer-to-peer; they emerge from the collective space of audience participation.

Decentralized storytelling requires navigating your human experience within a story-space. The architects of the story-space were your ancestors; it is a place in which your great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren will be born. It is a mind space, a physical space, and, for some, a game. It is a process of making and unmaking that cannot be sustained except in collaboration with the past and future, securing a connection with those living seven generations from now, listening to their experiences, and making stories that will be able to reach them where they are.

Decentralized storytelling requires navigating your human experience within a story-space.
In what follows, I will try to give you a map of the story-space. You can look at this map while you are strolling through the 21st century landscape, so you will know when you have stumbled upon one.</p>
<br>
<p><span>How can you tell if you are in a decentralized story-space?</span>

<span>Can it be embodied in multiple media?</span>

One good indication you’re dealing with a decentralized narrative is that it’s distributed across multiple media. Consider big mainstream franchises like X-Men or Star Wars, for which there are movies, comics, novelizations, video games, and toys. Each entry to these fictional universes introduces new elements that push the narrative in different directions and force the canon to expand.

Of course, these stories still fall under the jurisdiction of their corporate custodians. A more decentralized story-space might be the Homestuck universe, the sprawling, 8,000-page saga about “a boy and his friends and a game they play together.” It began as a webcomic but has also been developed in animated videos, and a game. When he created the series, Andrew Husse made everything in MS Paint — easy-to-use software that ships with Windows — and drew the characters in a rudimentary fashion. This made it easy for fans to replicate the characters on their own computers, and the Homestuck world flourishes as fanfic. With its multiverses and alternate timelines, the material that fans generate can be incorporated back into the canon (even the chat logs on Husse’s MS Paint Adventures is considered canon). It promotes radical inclusivity on every level; fans don’t feel like they need permission to enter into it and interact.</p>
<br>
<p><span>Does it take a long time to tell?</span>

Next time you meet a Homestuck fan, ask them to summarize the story. If you’re not met with dismissive laughter, odds are you are in for several hours of confusion as they try to relate a profoundly convoluted plot that is still being written.
A decentralized story is open, which means there is a sense in which it is an ongoing performance, happening in real time. Not so with centralized stories; even those that take place in real time: Run Lola Run, My Dinner With Andre, and Dog Day Afternoon still take place in a scripted memory-space.
Decentralized stories happen in real time because they are mapped to real life. Following a news story on Twitter, for example, is a decentralized narrative unfolding in real-time (or something close to it.) In Twitch streams the audience watches a performer put on a show using the ready-made materials of a video game, all the while reading and responding to a live feed of comments from fans. Games such as Minecraft, VR Chat, or Eve Online for instance, don’t have any particular ends — they are just spaces in which people can come and act out stories for as long as they like.

<p><span>Does it involve a transparent system of transactions or trade?</span>

Economies form in collective spaces when people define what they value as a group. In some communities the store of value is attribution and credit (as on Tumblr); in others it is the value of objects needed for trade within the story-space (in-game economies), or even MacGuffins that serve no function except to drive the story.
Economies are an indication that a community has not only defined values but also the means of interacting with one another via exchange. Each group has protocols in which to interact with others outside of their group. (This is one reason why economists are so fascinated with game theory — EVE Online even has its own dedicated economist to help the society created in that story-space.)</p>

<p><span>Does the story make use of existing features of its world?</span>

A decentralized story gets its life from the people who participate in it. This is one reason that decentralization flourishes so well in the worlds of memes and fanfic — it’s easier to put on puppet shows with familiar characters than it is to create a whole new fictional universe from scratch. By using readymade features of an existing cultural landscape, and doing it on a platform that everyone can access, with tools that everyone has, decentralized stories make it possible for more people to participate in the telling of the story. An advancement that is accessible to more people will last longer and be more influential than one that is not.</p></div>
